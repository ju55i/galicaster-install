galicaster-install
==================

Post install script for Ubuntu 12.04.2 which configures Galicaster to start on boot without display manager.
It doesn't work out of the box because the dependencies on certain hardware setup. It also formats your /dev/sdb so be careful. :)
This repository doesn't include the binary drivers referenced in the script. Download them separately and them under the files directory.
